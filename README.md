Retrieval-Augmented Generation enables to generate answers and code snippets based on an index of documents (like a codebase stored in MATLAB Drive)

## Workflow

0. **Setup**: Install the required packages with `setup.m`
1. **Index**: Index the documents in the codebase with `index.m`
2. **Query**: Retrieve the relevant documents based on the query and generate the answer/code snippet with `query.m`
